# Kasper

This is a fork of the Ghost theme ported by [@Rosario](https://github.com/rosario). It has my custom modifications (personal data, added plugins, etc), so consider forking [the original repository](https://github.com/rosario/kasper) (it will be far more updated than mine).

## Thanks

Thanks to [@Rosario](https://github.com/rosario) for doing the port and [Ghost Foundation](https://ghost.org/about/) for creating it!
