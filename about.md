Hi there my friend! I’m a multidisciplinary developer currently living in Madrid (Spain) and working for ING Direct as a frontend and backend developer (with technologies ranging from Backbone, Marionette, CSS to Spring).

I'm very passionate about technologies like Android and NodeJs in general. For that reason I enjoy working in projects that stays in those areas (I'm an Android developer too!).

In my free time I try to commit my efforts to my personal projects where touches those technologies mentioned previously.

You're free to contact or to follow me. Currently I'm on:
